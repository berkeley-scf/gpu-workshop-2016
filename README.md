# gpu-workshop-2016
Materials for workshop on GPU computation for statistics, data science, machine learning applications. Please see gpu.html to be guided through the materials.

Session 1: Monday, Feb. 1, 4:10 - 5:30 pm in Evans 1011
* Introduction to GPU resources that are available (Savio, Amazon EC2)
* Basics of using GPUs with C, R, and Python

Session 2: Monday Feb. 8, 4:10 - 5:30 pm in Evans 1011
* Use of packages such as Caffe, TensorFlow, etc. that use GPUs for
back-end computation
* Discussion of use cases by those using GPUs currently
* Optimizing GPU usage

The workshop will be an introduction to using GPUs and will assume no
previous knowledge of GPUs. I will assume familiarity with either R,
C, or Python and at least modest familiarity with operating in a UNIX
environment. The goal is to get folks up to speed on using GPUs, and
we'll cover basic techniques for using a GPU with R, C, and Python.
